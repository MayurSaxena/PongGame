Pong Game
========

##Summary##
This Pong game features 1-player and 2-player modes, with both mouse and keyboard controls, as well as varying levels of difficulty. The game also has a highscores feature, which tracks the 8 highest scores.

##Technologies Used##
* Python **2** - Pygame is well supported for this version.
 * Python 3 support is possible. However, Pygame is in alpha (as of May 2015). I found the wheel file for Python 3.4 [here](http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pygame). I'm sure other versions can be found using your favorite search engine.
* Pygame module (see notes above)

##Other Information##
There are two executable files as part of this project, *w9xpopen* and *Pong*. If you just want to play the game, put the two EXE's and the **data** folder in the same location. Then, open the Pong EXE.

As of right now, these can only be run on Windows. However, I'm sure there are ways to compile binaries from Python for Mac and Linux as well! Alternatively, you could just run the source code.
